# Word file token replacer
 Replaces token words in .docx files

Just download the Apache POI libraries, import them into the project and you'll be ready to go!
Set your own tokens into a word document and use this as a template to dinamically fill in your data into the document without having to rewrite it every time. Useful if you sign a lot of standard contracts =)
